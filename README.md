# FullStack-CRUD-ReactJS-SpringBoot-MySQL-Axios
This is a simple CRUD full stack Employee Management System webapp built using ReactJS for frontend, Spring Boot for server side, MySQL as db and Axios to make REST API calls from React.
The Spring Boot part of the project is mainly divided into few packages like model, repository and controller.
The React part of the project is mainly divided into router, service, components.
Bootstrap 4 was also used to style the frontend.
MySQL had only a single table to store the employee data. Although in real time applications, there would be multiple tables, this is just a basic CRUB application to experiment with basics of CRUD and REST using the above mentioned technologies.
React by itself can not make REST API calls, that's where Axios comes into picture which makes these calls easier for react.

Future Scope:
More fields and tables can be added.
More complex APIs can be built to handle more complex operations.
The UI can be improved.
